                        my career journey started in my undergraduate when I did co-op program at skyworks. i worked at 
                        skyworks from Jan 2018 to Sept 2018 in which that time I worked on creating a report generator application 
                        which a user could open data files, manage and plot data, then create power point presentations based on the graphs created. 
                        the application was a WPF application using C# as the programming language, this was my first introduction to C#.
                    </p>

                        After graduation, I started working at WorldStrides in Jan 2020 as a software engineer where I worked on series of web applications on both front and back end of the platform
                        WorldStrides is a education travel company that schedules and manages travel experiences for schools across the country. After a few 
                        months at WorldStrides, Covid hit, travel was haulted, and schools were closed. This hit the company hard as they were unable to make money during this time period. Due to this 
                        I made the decision to look for work at a more stable company that was not effected by covid as drastically.

                        In Aug 2020 I started at Abbott where I continue to work today. I work on a imbedded UWP application programming in C# and c++. 
                        Using the medical device physicians can image the arteries around the heart to diagnose the vessels and deploy stents. the software 
                        uses AI to diagnose areas of calcium within the arteries automatically. At Abbott, I work in a agile methodology contributing to a team of engineers 
                        where we work together to accomplish each release of the software. Since starting at Abbott, I have worked on 4 sequential releases of the software.
